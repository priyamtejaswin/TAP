`.txt` files contain question ids against names.

Each `.jpg` file is a question-id from the Val set. It contains:
* The question `Qs`
* The ground-truth answers `Gt`
* The predicted answers `Pr`
* The prediction source `Sr`
* Faster R CNN object bounding boxes and class labels on the left.
* OCR bounding boxes and text labels on the right.

Reach out if you can't read the texts, and I'll share access to the raw metadata. The files are a bit big, and I can't push them to git.
